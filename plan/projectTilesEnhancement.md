# expectations:

1. currently the project tile looks too big and many visitors may not be interested in viewing the details so here's how we will handle this.
2. on the top right of each tile, there will be a toggle button to see the details (being tech-stack and description). which on clicking again takes back to image.
3. the project name and link always stays fix at the bottom of the tile. buttons should become center align to each tile.  
4. the toggle button on clicking should create a nice transitions animation. something like converting content from that corner to whole tile.
