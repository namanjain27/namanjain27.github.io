# Work Done

## Phase 2: Projects Section Complete Redesign

### Changes Made:
- Created separate CSS file (`css/projects.css`) for projects section styling to declutter main HTML file
- Converted horizontal card layout to responsive CSS Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- Added 4 new projects (Portfolio Website, IP Management AI Chatbot, Titanium Alloy Creep Analysis, Vendor Cost Update Module) to reach 6 total projects
- Added tech stack icons/badges for each project using Icons8 CDN links
- Implemented hover effects with smooth transitions and scaling animations
- Enhanced project cards with proper responsive design and dark mode support
- Added multiple project links (View Project, Play Store, Live Demo, etc.) for better user experience
- Removed redundant CSS from main HTML file and organized code better

### Features Added (User Perspective):
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Projects now display in an organized grid that adapts to screen size (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- **More Projects**: Expanded from 2 to 6 projects showcasing diverse skills across game development, AI, web development, and enterprise software
- **Tech Stack Visualization**: Each project now shows the technologies used with colorful icons and labels
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Improved hover effects on project cards and images with smooth animations
- **Better Navigation**: Multiple action buttons per project (View Project, Live Demo, Play Store links where applicable)
