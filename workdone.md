# Work Done

## Phase 2: Projects Section Complete Redesign

### Changes Made:
- Created separate CSS file (`css/projects.css`) for projects section styling to declutter main HTML file
- Converted horizontal card layout to responsive CSS Grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- Added 4 new projects (Portfolio Website, IP Management AI Chatbot, Titanium Alloy Creep Analysis, Vendor Cost Update Module) to reach 6 total projects
- Added tech stack icons/badges for each project using Icons8 CDN links
- Implemented hover effects with smooth transitions and scaling animations
- Enhanced project cards with proper responsive design and dark mode support
- Added multiple project links (View Project, Play Store, Live Demo, etc.) for better user experience
- Removed redundant CSS from main HTML file and organized code better

### Features Added (User Perspective):
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: Projects now display in an organized grid that adapts to screen size (3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, 1 on mobile)
- **More Projects**: Expanded from 2 to 6 projects showcasing diverse skills across game development, AI, web development, and enterprise software
- **Tech Stack Visualization**: Each project now shows the technologies used with colorful icons and labels
- **Enhanced Interactivity**: Improved hover effects on project cards and images with smooth animations
- **Better Navigation**: Multiple action buttons per project (View Project, Live Demo, Play Store links where applicable)
- **Improved Visual Appeal**: Consistent card design with proper spacing, shadows, and responsive images

## Phase 2 Debug: Layout Issues Fixed

### Issues Resolved:
- **Desktop Projects Layout**: Removed conflicting CSS rules from main styles.css that were overriding CSS Grid layout with old absolute positioning and float styles
- **Lead Content Visibility**: The existing CSS fix for lead-content visibility on screens >992px was already in place and working correctly
- **Project Card Structure**: Ensured proper vertical layout order (image → title → tech stack → description → buttons) across all screen sizes

### Technical Fixes:
- Removed old project styling rules (.project, .project-image, .project-info) from css/styles.css that used absolute positioning and float layout
- Cleaned up conflicting responsive rules that were hiding project images and altering layout
- Maintained separation of concerns with dedicated projects.css for all project-related styling

## Phase 3: Dark Mode Experience Tiles and Z-Index Fixes

### Changes Made:
- Reverted experience tiles dark mode styling to match education section styling for consistency
- Enhanced experience tiles hover effects to use stronger shadow effects 
- Ensured social widgets maintain consistent light mode appearance in dark mode across all screen sizes

## Phase 4: Timeline Animations Implementation

### Changes Made:
- Added scroll-triggered animations for experience timeline section with smooth reveal effects
- Implemented staggered animation delays (0.1s-0.6s) for timeline items to create sequential appearance
- Created enhanced hover interactions for all timeline elements (icons, dates, content)
- Added timeline line animation that scales from top to bottom when section comes into view
- Implemented icon pulse animations and enhanced visual feedback on hover

### Features Added (User Perspective):
- **Smooth Timeline Reveals**: Timeline items now animate into view smoothly as user scrolls down
- **Staggered Animations**: Each timeline item appears with a slight delay creating a flowing effect
- **Interactive Timeline Icons**: Icons pulse with neon glow and react to hover with scale and rotation effects  
- **Enhanced Hover Effects**: Dates change color and lift up, content slides right with shimmer effect
- **Animated Timeline Line**: The vertical timeline line draws itself from top to bottom when visible
